# Tweeter
A twitter-like application that has users and microposts. I'm writing it as I learn how to use Ruby on Rails using this book: https://www.railstutorial.org/book

To use this app: 

* Clone the repository to your local machine
* Install gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

* More to come
