# Tweeter
A twitter-like application that has users and microposts. I'm writing it as I learn hwo to use Ruby On rails using the book by Micheal Hartl: https://www.railstutorial.org/book

To use this app: 

* Clone the repository to your local machine
* Install gems:

'''
$ bundle install --without production
'''

* More to come
